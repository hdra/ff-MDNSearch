#MDNSearch

A Firefox plugin that adds an option to search the current selection
on MDN.

Just a simple plugin to show the basics of the Firefox plugin API, not really
meant for actual use. It doesn't handle plenty of use cases, and it also relies 
on Google's Feeling Lucky version to directly open the first search first result.
